Since the early development of some of the first computer networks, network engineers have been striving to develop networks and networking protocols that can facilitate an overall much more efficient, effective, and in some cases, user friendly experience than that of the previous generation. Conceived in the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET) is often hailed as the first computer network to be developed for the purpose of exchanging small amounts of data between computer systems that were physically separated.
