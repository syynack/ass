Block ciphers are one of the most popular forms of current cryptography.
In difference to stream ciphers, block ciphers work most commonly by iterating over many “blocks” of a piece of plaintext and producing blocks of cipher text of an equal size.
One key feature of a block cipher over a stream cipher, is the need to commonly add padding to a message. 
For example, if the cipher is using a block size of a typical 64 bits, it is very rare that a plaintext message modulo 64 will be zero; there will often be some bits remaining that are not divisible by 64.
The cipher therefore needs to padding to the last block of the plain text message so that it can be operated on as a 64 bit block.

Within block ciphers there are many different forms of operations - this relates to the different ways in which the cipher can be applied to the block of plain text.
